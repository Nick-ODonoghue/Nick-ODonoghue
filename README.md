## About Me

I've spent the last 5 years in the IT industry, most recently as a senior analyst for one of the UK's largest retail brands. While I enjoyed my work, I realized that I wanted to specialize more in my career. With my passion for all things tech and the web, I decided that web development was the perfect fit for me.

After taking a 9-week bootcamp at Le Wagon, I'm excited to say that I now have the skills to create full-stack web applications! Over the past few months, I've been learning HTML, CSS, and JS, Ruby and Ruby on Rails and I've loved every minute of it. I have a passion for learning, whether it's something familiar or completely new.
