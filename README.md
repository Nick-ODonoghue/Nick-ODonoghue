## About Me

I've spent the last 5 years in the IT industry, most recently as a senior analyst for one of the UK's largest retail brands. While I enjoyed my work, I realized that I wanted to specialize more in my career. With my passion for all things tech and the web, I decided that web development was the perfect fit for me.

I'm now a junior full-stack web developer experienced in HTML, CSS, Tailwindcss, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Node.js & Express. I believe in mobile-first responsive development and have a keen eye for creating seamless user experiences.
